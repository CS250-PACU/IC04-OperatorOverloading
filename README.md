# IC04-OperatorOverloading
The solution includes Rational and RationalSet. Students need to overload operators.

# class Rational
1.	overload << to output a Rational object in the form 1/2.
2.	overload >> to input a Rational object in the form 1/2.
3.	overload * to multiply two Rational objects returning a Rational object. Do not modify either Rational object being multiplied.
4.	overload == to test whether two Rational objects are equal. In this case 1/2 is not equal to 2/4

# RationalSet Driver
1.	Implement each function and uncomment the driver code.

# class RationalSet
1.	overload << to output a RationalSet object in the form {1/2 2/3 3/4}.
2.	overload + to add a Rational object to a RationalSet. Do not allow duplicates.
3.	overload == to test whether two RationalSet objects are equal. 
4.	overload >> to input a RationalSet object in the form {1/2 2/3 3/4}. This is the hardest function to write. Further, an acceptable set like the one shown can have no trailing space after { or a preceding space in front of }. This makes the input easier.

# RationalSet Driver
1.	Implement each function and uncomment the driver code.
