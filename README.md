# IC04-OperatorOverloading
The solution includes the following projects that build:
- Rational
- RationalSet
- RationalUnitTests

# Mission
Your mission is to get complete all of the functions that 
fail the unit tests.

**Please complete one step at a time**

# RationalUnitTests
Build and run the project RationalUnitTests. The project should build
and run, but most of the tests will fail. Your goal is to complete the
missing code from the functions in Rational.cpp so that all the unit
tests pass. You can complete the functions in any order you like, or 
use the recommended order below.

# class Rational
1. Complete the code for operator *. Run the unit tests to make sure
they pass.
2. Complete the code for operator ==. Run the unit tests to make sure
they pass.
3. Complete the code for operator <<. Run the unit tests to make sure
they pass.
3. Complete the code for operator >>. Run the unit tests to make sure
they pass.

# Rational Driver
Uncomment the code in Rational driver. If all the unit tests pass, then
the code will run correctly. Verify this before moving to the next 
step.

# RationalSetUnitTests
Build and run the project RationalSetUnitTests. The project should 
build and run, but most of the tests will fail. Your goal is to 
complete the missing code from the functions in RationalSet.cpp so 
that all the unit tests pass. You can complete the functions in any 
order you like, or use the recommended order below.

# class RationalSet 
1. Complete the code for operator <<. Run the unit tests to make sure
they pass.
2. Complete the code for operator ==. Run the unit tests to make sure
they pass.
3. Complete the code for operator >>. Run the unit tests to make sure
they pass.
3. Complete the code for operator +. Run the unit tests to make sure
they pass.

# RationalSet Driver
Uncomment the code in RationalSet driver. If all the unit tests pass, 
then the code will run correctly. Verify this before moving to the next 
step.

# OPTIONAL
1. [OPTIONAL] overload * to return the intersection of two RationalSet 
objects. Do not modify either RationalSet object.
2. [OPTIONAL] Add a unit tes to test operator *
3. [OPTIONAL] Write some code to the driver that uses operator *
